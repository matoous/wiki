## Staff Engineer

### Responsibilities

**Setting technical direction**: providing vision for long-term technical development of
specific area, e.g. API design.
  - getting people from vague sense of "getting better" to clear idea of what "better" is and why

**Mentorship & Sponsorship**[^1]: sharing experience and advice along with understanding the recipient's context.

**Providing engineering perspective**: self descriptive.

**Exploration**: being assigned on new or burning topics to quickly iterate on finding a solution
(or failing to do so which is fine as well).

**Being glue**[^2]: doing the needed but often invisible work to keep the gears turning.

- Timeframes get longer with higher titles, early on in the career the development cycle can be within weeks or months.
  In senior roles it shifts to months, quarters, or even longer.
