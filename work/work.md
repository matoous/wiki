- [**Cynefin** for Developers](https://lizkeogh.com/cynefin-for-developers/)
  - classifies 4 kinds of problems:
    1. **Obvious**: tightly constrained, no degrees of freedom, sense-categorise-respond, apply best practice. E.g. a bike chain falling off - the reaction is "Oh, it's one of these problems", there's one and only best practice to solving it.
    2. **Complicated**: governing constraints, tightly coupled, sense-analyse-respond, apply good practice. E.g. repairing a watch, the solution is predictable but requires expertise, usually have more than one way to solve.
    3. **Complex**: enabling constraints, loosly coupled, probe-sense-respond, emergent practice. Acting in this space causes the space to change, cause and effect can only be understood in retrospect. Try solution that can fail, safely, to understand the problem. We need to change our practices around the problem.
    4. **Chaotic**: lacking constraints, decoupled, act-sense-respond, novel pratice. E.g. the hause catching fire - first we _act_. New practices emerge that can make us help things safer in the future.
  - If you’ve done it before, requirements are known.
  - If someone else has done it before, requirements are knowable, having conversations about the problem can provide understanding of the domain.
  - If it’s never been done before by anyone, requirements will change.
