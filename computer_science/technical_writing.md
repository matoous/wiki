  - considerations:
    - Are you unsure about the right software design, and would it make sense to spend upfront time to gain certainty?
    - Relatedly, would it help to involve senior engineers, who might not be able to review every code-change, in the design?
    - Is the software design ambiguous or even contentious such that achieving organizational consensus around it would be valuable?
    - Does my team sometimes forget to consider privacy, security, logging or other cross-cutting concerns in the design?
    - Is there a strong need for documents that provide high-level insights into the design of legacy systems in the organization?
