## Resources

- [Don't use VPN services.](https://gist.github.com/joepie91/5a9909939e6ce7d09e29)
  - "The $10/month that you're paying for your VPN service doesn't even pay for the lawyer's coffee, so expect them to hand you over."
  - assume all VPNs log everything about you
  - use VPN only if:
    - you are in well known hostile network (WiFi at the Airport, ISP that is known for MITMing)
    - want to hide your IP for very specific non-government-sanctioned adversaries, e.g. circumventing ban in chat room
