## MPU

[memory protection unit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memory_protection_unit) (MPU), is a computer hardware unit that provides memory protection. It is usually implemented as part of the central processing unit (CPU). MPU is a trimmed down version of memory management unit (MMU) providing only memory protection support. It is usually implemented in low power processors that require only memory protection and do not need the full-fledged feature of a memory management unit like virtual memory management.
