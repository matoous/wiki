# Computer Science


- **maintain one source of truth** - if there are two sources of truth, one is probably wrong. If it's not wrong, it's not wrong yet. 

## Dictionary

- [The Cathedral and the Bazaar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Cathedral_and_the_Bazaar)
  - Every good work of software starts by scratching a developer's personal itch.
  - Good programmers know what to write. Great ones know what to rewrite (and reuse). (edit: _"What not to write"_)
  - Plan to throw one [version] away; you will, anyhow (copied from Frederick Brooks's [The Mythical Man-Month](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Mythical_Man-Month)).
  - If you have the right attitude, interesting problems will find you.
  - When you lose interest in a program, your last duty to it is to hand it off to a competent successor.
  - Treating your users as co-developers is your least-hassle route to rapid code improvement and effective debugging.
  - [Release early. Release often.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Release_early,_release_often) And listen to your customers.
  - Given a large enough beta-tester and co-developer base, almost every problem will be characterized quickly and the fix obvious to someone.
  - Smart data structures and dumb code works a lot better than the other way around.
  - If you treat your beta-testers as if they're your most valuable resource, they will respond by becoming your most valuable resource.
  - The next best thing to having good ideas is recognizing good ideas from your users. Sometimes the latter is better.
  - Often, the most striking and innovative solutions come from realizing that your concept of the problem was wrong.
  - Perfection (in design) is achieved not when there is nothing more to add, but rather when there is nothing more to take away. (attributed to [Antoine de Saint-Exupéry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antoine_de_Saint-Exup%C3%A9ry))
  - Any tool should be useful in the expected way, but a truly great tool lends itself to uses you never expected.
  - When writing gateway software of any kind, take pains to disturb the data stream as little as possible—and never throw away information unless the recipient forces you to!
  - A security system is only as secure as its secret. Beware of pseudo-secrets.
  - To solve an interesting problem, start by finding a problem that is interesting to you.
  - Provided the development coordinator has a communications medium at least as good as the Internet, and knows how to lead without coercion, many heads are inevitably better than one.
