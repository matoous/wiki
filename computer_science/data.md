# Data

- [**Extract, transform, load**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extract,_transform,_load) is a three-phase process where data is extracted, transformed (cleaned, sanitized, scrubbed) and loaded into an output data container. The data can be collated from one or more sources and it can also be output to one or more destinations. ETL processing is typically executed using software applications but it can also be done manually by system operators. ETL software typically automates the entire process and can be run manually or on reccurring schedules either as single jobs or aggregated into a batch of jobs.
