# Finance

I currently actively use 2 bank accounts, one with [Revolut](https://www.revolut.com/en-CZ/), the other one with Czech [AirBank](https://www.airbank.cz/).

I [invest](/economics/investing.md) at [Trading212](https://www.trading212.com/), [InteractiveBrokers](https://www.interactivebrokers.co.uk/en/home.php) and [Mintos](https://www.mintos.com/en/).

In general, I try to follow these rules:

- Don't by stuff you don't really need.
- Sell stuff you don't really need.

## Notes

- Financial independence isn't really that hard, if one is able to put aside 50% of income, he should be able to retire in 16 years. Save 62% and you can retire in less than 12 years. The key is to minimize spending and maximize savings.[^1]
- On the other hand, I think it is important to not stress it too much and also enjoy the life. The point of financial independence is to make your life better and more enjoyable.
