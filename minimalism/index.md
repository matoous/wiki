# Minimalism

Minimalism is not necessarily about having less things, there's a fine line between having minimalistic lifestyle and basically being masochistic. As a minimalist, you are allowed to want things, and own them. There's nothing wrong with it. More important is to be considerate about what you own and buy and whether you need it. In other words, if being minimalist causes you more stress, you are doing it wrong.
