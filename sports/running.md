## Race fueling

### Before

- Cut out fiber 2 days before the race, most people also mention switchin to whole wheat.
- Closer to the race mostly plain food such as white rice, white meat, eggs, yogurt.
- Last meal 3-4 hours before the race.

### During

- Rule of thumb is to have something small every 45 minutes
- The body can absorb between 150-300 calories an hour (while consuming around 600-1000 during an ultra)
  - For reference, 40g Muarten gel is 100 calories, their drink mixes come in 160 or 320 calories
- Some protein intake during the race is also important. Tom Evans mentions 5g every other hour.
- Tom Evans metions rice balls and pizza rolls during the race
- Other notable mentions: pre cooked halloumi, soup, nuts

> The biggest risk to you is you stop eating and your stomach shuts down. It’s pretty much game over from there. If you can get something, ANYTHING down, do it.
