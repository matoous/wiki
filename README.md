# [Wiki](https://matousdzivjak.gitbook.io/personal/)

👋 Welcome to my personal Wiki/Knowledge base. Originally hosted
on [Notion](https://www.notion.so/), currently moved to [GitHub](https://github.com/matoous/wiki)
and hosted on [Gitbook]( https://www.gitbook.com/ ) (Notion was fine, but missed navigation
sidebar 🙁).

This Wiki is heavily inspired by [this one](https://wiki.nikitavoloboev.xyz/)
by [ Nikita Voloboev ](https://nikitavoloboev.xyz/) and I strongly recommend
you take a look at it as I still find it incomprehensible how much information
and links can one collect over the time.
