# Food

- [_Agroforestry_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agroforestry) is a land use management system in which trees or shrubs are grown around or among crops or pastureland.
  Trees produce a wide range of useful and marketable products from fruits/nuts, medicines, wood products, etc.
  This intentional combination of agriculture and forestry has multiple benefits, such as greatly enhanced yields from staple food crops,
  enhanced farmer livelihoods from income generation, increased biodiversity, improved soil structure and health, reduced erosion, and carbon sequestration.
  Agroforestry practices are highly beneficial in the tropics, especially in subsistence smallholdings in sub-Saharan Africa and have been found to be beneficial in Europe and the United States.
